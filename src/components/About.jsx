            I'm a first-year BTech Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence student at Rishihood University (NST), 
            passionate about building web and AI projects. I'm a Hacktoberfest 2024 Contributor, GDG Ideathon Runner-Up, 
            and open-source enthusiast. I enjoy problem-solving, learning from real-world challenges, and occasionally 
            sketching over a cup of tea.
